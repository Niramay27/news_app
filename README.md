# news_app
This is a learning project about API fetching and using it on website. 

In this project, I have used html for basic layout and fetched the nav-bar,new container,pagination from Bootstrap. 
An API was borrowed from news.api website to fetch the news. This api is free of cost and can only accept request from server site but not client site. Therefore, could not be deployed online.
